You're an experienced programmer looking to get up and running quickly with Go. You want the knowledge, tools, and techniques to write idiomatic, professional-grade Go using fun exercises that get you comfortable with the language and its ecosystem. This is the workshop you're looking for.

This immersive and hands-on workshop equips you with the essential knowledge and practical experience to become a proficient Go developer. Throughout this intensive training, you'll discover the core principles and advanced techniques that make Go a standout language for building robust and high-performance applications.

#### What a student is expected to learn

* Comprehensive Introduction: Gain a solid understanding of Go's syntax, data types, control flow, and package management system.
* Go Tools: Get to know the tool chain for building, testing, benchmarking, and profiling your programs.
* Effective Error Handling: Discover Go's approach to error handling and techniques for creating robust, failure-resistant code.
* Testing: Use the standard library package and other community favorites along with advanced techniques for testing.
* Benchmarking: Take advantage of built-in performance optimization tools.
* Generics: Understand how to leverage parametric polymorphism to remove boilerplate from your code.
* HTTP Servers and Clients: Learn how to write resilient servers and clients along with techniques such as throttling and backoff.
* Concurrency: Learn how to use goroutines, channels, and how thread synchronization works. Leverage techniques such as worker pools, semaphores, and pipelines to take full advantage of Go concurrency.
* Dependency Management: Go beyond the standard library to work with third-party packages securely. You'll publish your own packages, learn to isolate your CI build from repository outages, and more.
* OpenTelemetry: Build observable Go applications by instrumenting them to emit traces and metrics.

#### Some of what you'll work on during the workshop

* Build command line tooling
* Build a REST API with a Database
* Write a Highly-Concurrent Port Scanner
* Write a Load Balancer
* Build a URL Shortener and deploy with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB
* Work with Large Language Models (LLMs) in your projects

#### Prerequisites

* Complete the [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
* Browse through [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
* Introduce yourself to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) (optional but recommended)
* Introduce yourself to LLMs concepts

#### Preparation

* Have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
* Have an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) account
* Have an AWS account and the [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured locally (the services we use will fit comfortably with the free tier AWS provides)
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Have a functioning [Go environment](https://golang.org/dl/) installed with Go 1.22 or later
* Use an editor/IDE with Go plugin installed
